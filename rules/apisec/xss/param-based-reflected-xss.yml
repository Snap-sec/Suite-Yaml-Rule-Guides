report:
  title: "Reflected XSS detected"
  description: >-
    A reflected XSS payload (`<script>alert(0)</script>`) injected into a
    request parameter was reflected back in the response body (and the response
    has an HTML content-type). This indicates a reflected cross-site scripting
    vulnerability where user input is returned without proper HTML encoding.
    Original: {{original.method}} {{original.url}}
    Tested:   {{req.method}} {{req.url}}
    Matched:  {{match.criteria}}
    Status:   {{res.status}} | Content-Type: {{res.headers.Content-Type}}
  severity: high
  cwe: "CWE-79"
  cvssScore: "6.1"
  mitigation: >-
    Properly HTML-encode or sanitize all user-controlled input before rendering
    in HTML contexts. Use context-aware encoding libraries and CSP as defense-in-depth.
  stepsToReproduce: |
    1) Send baseline request: {{original.method}} {{original.url}}
    2) Re-send while replacing a single parameter value with: <script>alert(0)</script>
    3) Observe the payload reflected in the HTML response and executed in a browser context.

  impact: >-
    Successful reflected XSS can lead to session hijacking, credential theft,
    forced actions, and the ability to run arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers.
